**Task 1: Short Story Plot**

Title: The Lost Art of Memories

Plot Idea:

Protagonist Emma, a young and talented artist, discovers an old, mysterious locket in her attic that belonged to her great-grandmother. As she touches the locket, she is suddenly transported back in time to her great-grandmother's childhood, where she experiences a series of vivid memories that weren't her own.

As Emma navigates these unfamiliar memories, she begins to uncover hidden secrets about her family's past and the true meaning behind her great-grandmother's famous art piece, "Echoes in Time." With each new discovery, Emma must confront her own identity and the choices she has made in life.

Will Emma be able to find a way back home, or will she become trapped in this timeless journey, reliving memories that aren't hers?

**Task 2: Poem about Nature**

Title: Whispering Woods

Poem:

In whispers of wind, I hear your voice
A gentle breeze that rustles leaves and choice
The ancient trees stand tall and still
Guardians of secrets, hidden till

The sunlight filters through the canopy above
A dappled dance of light, a wondrous love
For every leaf, for every branch so fine
A work of art, a symphony divine

In forest depths, where creatures roam free
I find my peace, my serenity
The rustle of leaves, the chirping of birds
A melody that calms my troubled words

So let me wander in these whispering woods
Where nature's beauty never fades or loads
For in its heart, I find a peaceful nest
A haven where my soul can rest.
