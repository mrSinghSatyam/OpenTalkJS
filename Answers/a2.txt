**Code Documentation (Q1)**

Code documentation is essential for maintaining and understanding complex software systems. It provides a clear explanation of how the code works, making it easier for developers to modify and extend existing functionality.

### Code Documentation Best Practices

* Use clear and concise language in comments
* Organize comments by function or section of code
* Include relevant information about variables, functions, and classes
* Use documentation tools like Doxygen or Javadoc to generate HTML documentation
* Keep comments up-to-date with changes to the codebase

### Example Code Documentation

```java
/**
 * Calculates the sum of two integers.
 *
 * @param num1 first integer
 * @param num2 second integer
 * @return sum of num1 and num2
 */
public int add(int num1, int num2) {
    return num1 + num2;
}
```

### Code Documentation Tools

* Doxygen: A popular tool for generating HTML documentation from code comments.
* Javadoc: A built-in Java tool for generating HTML documentation from Java source files.

**API Documentation (Q2)**

API documentation is crucial for ensuring that external developers can effectively use and integrate with your software. It provides a clear explanation of the API's functionality, usage guidelines, and potential pitfalls.

### API Documentation Best Practices

* Use clear and concise language in documentation
* Organize documentation by API endpoint or function
* Include relevant information about request and response formats
* Use examples to illustrate API usage
* Keep documentation up-to-date with changes to the API

### Example API Documentation

```markdown
# User Authentication API

## Endpoints

### Get User Information

* URL: `/users/{userId}`
* Method: GET
* Response:
 + 200 OK: user information in JSON format
 + 404 Not Found: user not found
```

### API Documentation Tools

* Swagger: A popular tool for generating HTML documentation and RESTful API definitions.
* Apiblueprint: A simple tool for generating API documentation from Markdown files.

**Bug Report (Q3)**

A bug report is a detailed document that describes the issue, its symptoms, and any relevant information about the problem. It helps developers identify and reproduce the issue, and ultimately fix it.

### Bug Report Best Practices

* Be clear and concise in describing the issue
* Include relevant information such as error messages, stack traces, or screenshots
* Provide steps to reproduce the issue (if possible)
* Use a standard bug report template or format
* Keep the report up-to-date with progress on resolving the issue
